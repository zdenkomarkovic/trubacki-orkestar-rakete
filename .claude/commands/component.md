When creating new UI sections or features:

1. ALWAYS create reusable components in the /components directory
2. Extract all code into separate component files instead of writing inline code in pages
3. Follow the existing component structure in the project
4. Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props
5. Keep page files minimal - they should only import and compose components
